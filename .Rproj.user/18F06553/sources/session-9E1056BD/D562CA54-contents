I was born and raised in the Haidian District of Beijing, which is rich in educational resources and brings together some of the most talented and hardworking people in the country. At my alma mater, Beijing National Day School, I discovered my talent for natural science studies and won the second prize in the National Middle School Physics Olympiad during my high school years. This strengthened my decision to choose science and technology as my college major, which eventually led me to study at Zhejiang University, known as the "Cambridge of the East" and famous for its science and technology.

In the university, I made friends from different professional backgrounds and with various interests. I gradually realized that being alone with cold lab equipment was not my ideal lifestyle. By accumulating some business internship experience, I decided that I'd prefer to work with people and hope to develop a career in business field. During my internship at MasterCard Data & Services, I had a complete and in-depth experience of the daily work of a consultant and used my analytical skills to solve a series of strategic challenges for our clients. It is my passion to help clients solve their problems, and I am proud of the profound impact I have made on their company and even the industry.

At London Business School, I will continue to arm myself with analytical skills and be trained in a more systematic approach to solve business challenges. I believe that my master's program will not only teach me to conduct analysis, but also enable me to broaden my horizon and meet more like-minded and excellent peers.
