#Spotify Data Analysis

We have downloaded a large dataset on spotify songs and are going to analyse what makes a track popular.

```{r, download_spotify_data}

spotify_songs <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv')
```

The data dictionary can be found below

| danceability             | double    | Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| energy                   | double    | Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.                                                                                                                          |
| key                      | double    | The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| loudness                 | double    | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| mode                     | double    | Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| speechiness              | double    | Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |
| acousticness             | double    | A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| instrumentalness         | double    | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.                                                                                                                 |
| liveness                 | double    | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| valence                  | double    | A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| tempo                    | double    | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| duration_ms              | double    | Duration of song in milliseconds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
Before we can get into analysing this dataset, we need to examine the distribution of the popularity of tracks on spotify. See below the histogram that shows the distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = track_popularity) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    title = 'Many songs have a popularity of 0 on spotify',
    subtitle = 'A histogram of the popularity rating of spotify songs',
    x = 'Popularity rating',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
  
```

The track popularity seems to be a roughly normal distribution, with a lot of tracks with close to 0 popularity that do not fit with the distribution. This can be explained by a lot of small artists posting their own songs that not many people listen to, like someone creating a new podcast in their garage. Like in the music industry in general, not everyone makes it.


To start determining why some songs are more popular than others, we first show the distribution and summary statistics of the variables. We will try to see if we can determine whether the features look like a normal distribution.

```{r}
skim(spotify_songs) # seeing if we can determine whether the audio features look like a normal distribution

ggplot(spotify_songs) +

    x = 'Acousticness',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
# acousticness looks like an exponential distribution, with most songs not having any acousticness at all.

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = liveness) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(

#Liveness is skewed right. Most songs have some liveness, but a few have a lot.

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = speechiness) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(

    subtitle = 'Distribution of Speechiness',
    x = 'Speechiness',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
#Speechiness is an exponential distribution, similar to acousticness. Speechiness, however, has very few songs with exactly 0 speechiness.

    x = 'Instrumentalness',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
#Instrumentalness is skewed right. The vast majority of songs have a 0 instrumentalness, but there's another small bump around 0.8 where some songs have a lot of instrumentalness.

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = energy) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    title = 'Energy is normally distributed with a cutoff',
    subtitle = 'Distribution of Energy',
    x = 'Energy',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
#Energy looks like a normal distribution, with a mean around 0.75. However, it is cut off at 1 so it is not a normal distribution.

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = loudness) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    title = 'Loudness is normally distributed with a small standard deviation',
    subtitle = 'Distribution of Loudness',
    x = 'Loudness',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'

#Loudness looks like a normal distribution with a very small standard deviation, though it is slightly skewed left. 

ggplot(spotify_songs) +

    x = 'Valence',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
#Valence looks like a normal distribution that's cut off at 0 and 1.

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = tempo) +
  geom_histogram()  +
  labs(
    title = 'Tempo  is bimodal normally distributed',
    subtitle = 'Distribution of Tempo',
    x = 'Tempo',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
#Tempo looks like a bimodal noraml distribution, with the 2 peaks being 2 means. 

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = duration_ms) +
  geom_histogram()  +
  labs(
    title = 'Duration is normally distributed, skewed to the right',
    subtitle = 'Distribution of Duration',
    x = 'Duration',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
#Duration appears as a normal distribution with a skew to the right.

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = key) +
  geom_histogram()  +
  labs(
    title = 'Key can only be whole numbers',
    subtitle = 'Distribution of Key',
    x = 'Key',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
# The key does not have values everywhere on the scale, it looks like only whole numbers are possible on the key. 

ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(x = mode) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(
    title = 'Mode is either 1 (Major) or  0 (Minor)',
    subtitle = 'Distribution of Mode',
    x = 'Mode',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )
#  Mode only includes 0 or 1, nothing else.
```


We choose valence and danceability to start analysing what determines the track popularity. 


```{r}
ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(valence, track_popularity) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = 'Valence and track popularity appear unrelated',
    subtitle = 'Scatterplot of Valence and popularity',
    x = 'Valence',
    y = 'Popularity', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )

cor(spotify_songs$valence, spotify_songs$track_popularity)
```

Track popularity and valence do not appear to have a clear relationship, the values for both are spread out across the scatter plot and the correlation coefficient is very low.


```{r}
ggplot(spotify_songs) +
  aes(danceability, track_popularity) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = 'High danceability is related with a higher popularity',
    subtitle = 'Scatterplot of danceability and popularity',
    x = 'Danceability',
    y = 'Popularity', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )

cor(spotify_songs$danceability, spotify_songs$track_popularity)
```

The correlation coefficient is again very low, but a much higher danceability is associated with a slightly higher popularity. It seems that both of these tracks do not do much to predict the popularity of songs.

Next we determine whether the modality matters for the danceability and track popularity.

```{r}
mode_analysis <- spotify_songs %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  summarize(avg_danceability = mean(danceability),
            median_danceability = median(danceability),
            avg_popularity = mean(track_popularity),
            median_popularity = median(track_popularity))

mode_analysis
```


```{r}
library(BSDA)

spotify_songs %>%
  mutate(mode = factor(mode)) %>%
ggplot() +
  aes(x = danceability, fill = mode) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.2, position = 'identity') +
  labs(
    title = 'Danceability does not differ between major and minor',
    subtitle = 'Histograms of danceability for major (1) and minor (0) songs',
    x = 'Danceability',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )

mode1 <- filter(spotify_songs, mode == 1)
mode0 <- filter(spotify_songs, mode == 0)

```

There appears to be no significant difference in danceability between major and minor modes, as the mean appears in the same in both graphs and the spread does not appear different.

```{r}

spotify_songs %>%
  mutate(mode = factor(mode)) %>%
ggplot() +
  aes(x = track_popularity, fill = mode) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.2, position = 'identity') +
  labs(
    title = 'Track popularity does not differ between major and minor',
    subtitle = 'Histograms of Track popularity for major (1) and minor (0) songs',
    x = 'Track popularity',
    y = 'Count', 
    caption = 'Tidy Tuesday Spotify Songs dataset (accessed 04-09-2022)'
  )

mode1 <- filter(spotify_songs, mode == 1)
mode0 <- filter(spotify_songs, mode == 0)

```

There appears to be no significant difference in track_popularity between major and minor modes. Based on these analyses, we cannot yet decide what audio features determine the popularity of songs.
