### Rents in San Francisco 2000-2018

We are analysing a dataset of Craiglist listings for rental properties in the greater SF area.
The data dictionary is as follows

| variable    | class     | description           |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| post_id     | character | Unique ID             |
| date        | double    | date                  |
| year        | double    | year                  |
| nhood       | character | neighborhood          |
| city        | character | city                  |
| county      | character | county                |
| price       | double    | price in USD          |
| beds        | double    | n of beds             |
| baths       | double    | n of baths            |
| sqft        | double    | square feet of rental |
| room_in_apt | double    | room in apartment     |
| address     | character | address               |
| lat         | double    | latitude              |
| lon         | double    | longitude             |
| title       | character | title of listing      |
| descr       | character | description           |
| details     | character | additional details    |

The dataset was used in a recent [tidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project, which is where we sourced the data. 

```{r}
# download directly off tidytuesdaygithub repo

rent <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv')

```

We have conducted an analysis on the variables. View the analysis below.

```{r skim_data}
skimr::skim(rent)
str(rent)
head(rent)

```


Most column types correspond with what they should be, but date is stored as a double '20050111' instead of a date 2005-01-11. Other column types like number of bedrooms (beds) are a double where an integer suffices. We could change this to integer to use less storage space. Description has the most missing values, after which address and details follow with also 190000+ missing values.

We have plotted the top 20 cities in terms of % of rental listings. 

```{r top_cities}
# creating a dataset with the top 20 cities by number of listings
top_20_cities <- rent %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  filter(year < 2019) %>% # ensuring we have the right years
  summarize(total_listings = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = total_listings/sum(total_listings), # changing number to a percentage
         city = fct_reorder(city, total_listings)) %>% #ordering by # listings
  slice_max(total_listings, n=20) 

# graphing the top 20 cities as a barplot
ggplot(top_20_cities) +
  aes(x = percentage, y = city) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = 'San Fransisco accounts for more than a quarter of all rental classifieds',
    subtitle = '% of Craigslist listings, 2000-2018',
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    caption = 'Source: Pennington, Kate(2018). Bay Area Craigslist Rental Housing Posts, 2000-2018',
    xticks = 'percentage'
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_minimal(base_size=16)
  

```

It is clear that San Francisco is responsible for 25% of the listings, making that the most interesting city to start investigating. To analyse what is happening with the rental prices in San Francisco, we have plotted the evolution of median prices in San Francisco for 0, 1, 2 and 3 bedroom listings. 

```{r sf_median_prices}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

sf_rentals <- rent %>%
  filter(city == 'san francisco',
         beds < 4) %>% 
  mutate(beds = factor(beds)) %>%
  group_by(beds, year) %>%
  summarise(rent = median(price))
  

ggplot(sf_rentals) +
 aes(x = year, y = rent, color = beds) +
  facet_wrap(vars(beds), nrow = 1) +
  geom_line() +
  theme( legend.position = 'none') +
  labs(
    title = 'San Francisco rents have been steadily increasing',
    subtitle = '0 to 3-bed listings, 2000-2018',
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    caption = 'Source: Pennington, Kate(2018). Bay Area Craigslist Rental Housing Posts, 2000-2018',
  )


```

We see that the rents have been increasing sincd 2005, with an exception for the recession in 2008. Since 2015 we see another decrease in rents for all sizes. 

Having considered San Francisco, we turn to analyse the top 12 cities by number of listings in the Bay Area. We plot the median rental prices for those cities below.


```{r spirit_plot}

# determining the top 12 cities in terms of listings
top12_cities <- rent %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarize(total_listings = n()) %>%
  slice_max(total_listings, n=12)

# creating a vector with the city names
top12_cities <- top12_cities$city

# gathering the dataset to plot, focusing on 1-bedroom flats
one_bed_bay_area <- rent %>%
  filter(beds == 1,
         city %in% top12_cities) %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarize(rent = median(price))

# creating the plot
ggplot(one_bed_bay_area) +
  aes(x = year, y = rent, colour = city) +
  facet_wrap(vars(city)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme( legend.position = 'none') +
  labs(
    title = 'Rental prices for 1-bedroom flats in the Bay Area',
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    caption = 'Source: Pennington, Kate(2018). Bay Area Craigslist Rental Housing Posts, 2000-2018',
  )

```


We can clearly spot the financial crisis happening in 2008, when all the prices are going down across the cities and types of bedrooms in San Francisco. The effect is the smallest in Santa Rosa and Oakland, where we also don't see an increase ahead of the recession, so a limited decrease is not unsurprising. The effect is the greatest where the increase is also the greatest, for example a three-bedroom in San Francisco or Santa Clara.
